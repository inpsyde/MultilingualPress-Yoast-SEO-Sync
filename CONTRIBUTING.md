# Getting Started
* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free).

# Making Changes
* Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work.
    * This is usually the `master` branch.
    * Only target release branches if you are certain your fix must be on that branch.
    * To quickly create a topic branch based on the `master` branch:
        * `git checkout -b issue/%YOUR-ISSUE-NUMBER%_%DESCRIPTIVE-TITLE% master`
        * a good example is `issue/123_typo_in_foo`
    * Please avoid working directly on the `master` branch.
* Make commits of logical units.
